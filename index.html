                                    Hi my name is Taylor Wilburn. I hold two licenses, one as a barber and one as a cosmetologist. I have been working in this industry in and around the Tulsa area since 2009. As a Tulsa native, who graduated from the Tulsa School of Arts and Sciences, I take great pride in working with the men and women in my home town. After high school I attended and graduated from the Cosmetology Education Center. I went back to school in 2015 to obtain my certification in barbering. In my spare time I enjoy long boarding. I also consider myself a "beast master" because I live with and raise two giant dogs. My one true passion is saving men from their unfortunate facial hair and bad hair days:) At the shop I specialize in the old school hot towel straight razor shaves - try saying that three times fast. Please don't be shy, call or text me at 918-640-7194 for literally one of the best shaves around.... Trust me, you will not be disappointed!
